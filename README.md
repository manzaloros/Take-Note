# Take Note
Take Note is a musical ear-training memory game. It displays eight different colored boxes that when clicked, play different tones corresponding to the Western Classical major scale. At first, the boxes are in order, but once the user completes a round, the boxes are shuffled. In order to win subsequent rounds, the user must use their ear and memory to remember which box goes with which tone. If that sounds hard, it is!

* Users may change the scale to Minor, Lydian, or the Octatonic scale
* Stores user names and high scores in a persistent Postgres database
* Box shuffle order is randomized after the first round
* Points earned from correct box selection increase as the user wins more rounds
* Timer dramatically decreases as the user wins rounds
